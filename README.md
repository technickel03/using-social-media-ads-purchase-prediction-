# using-social-media-ads-purchase-prediction-
this projects contains a data set of the users of particular social network which were targeted for and vehicles ad. it contains data regrading income of user , age and whether he/she purchased the car. To predict the if certain user will purchase or not i've used different classification techniques 1)logistic regression 2)K-NN 3)Support Vector Machine(SVM) 4)Naive bayes 5)decision tree 6)random forest

I've included a classification template that is basicaly and outline to execute all the classification models easily.
you just have to create the classifier and you're ready to execute.
Keep in mind your dataset and choose matrix of features and independent variable carefully.

this project is part or udemy course of A-z machine learning.
